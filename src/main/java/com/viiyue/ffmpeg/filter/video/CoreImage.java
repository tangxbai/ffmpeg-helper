 * Video filtering on GPU using Appleâ€™s CoreImage API on OSX.
 * 
 * Hardware acceleration is based on an OpenGL context. Usually, this means it is processed by video hardware.
 * However, software-based OpenGL implementations exist which means there is no guarantee for hardware
 * processing. It depends on the respective OSX.
 * 
 * There are many filters and image generators provided by Apple that come with a large variety of options.
 * The filter has to be referenced by its name along with its options.
