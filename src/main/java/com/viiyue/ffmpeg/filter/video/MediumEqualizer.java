 * Apply Midway Image Equalization effect using two video streams.

 * <p>
 * Midway Image Equalization adjusts a pair of images to have the same histogram, while maintaining their
 * dynamics as much as possible. Itâ€™s useful for e.g. matching exposures from a pair of stereo cameras.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This filter has two inputs and one output, which must be of same pixel format, but may be of different
 * sizes. The output of filter is first input adjusted with midway histogram of both inputs.
