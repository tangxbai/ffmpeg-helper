/**
 * <p>
 * Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the progressive frames from a
 * telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine
 * fieldmatch needs to be followed by a decimation filter such as decimate in the filtergraph.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by the possibility of
 * inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two. If the source has mixed telecined and real
 * interlaced content, fieldmatch will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts. But these
 * remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be de-interlaced by a later filter such
 * as yadif before decimation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition to the various configuration options, fieldmatch can take an optional second stream, activated
 * through the ppsrc option. If enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from
 * this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to help the various algorithms
 * of the filter, while keeping the output lossless (assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a
 * field-aware denoiser, or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project) and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth
 * project). The later is a light clone of TFM from which fieldmatch is based on. While the semantic and usage
 * are very close, some behaviour and options names can differ.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The decimate filter currently only works for constant frame rate input. If your input has mixed telecined
 * (30fps) and progressive content with a lower framerate like 24fps use the following filterchain to produce
 * the necessary cfr stream: dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate.
