/**
 * <p>
 * Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This filter has several different modes of operation; which one is used depends on the input and output
 * formats:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Hardware frame input, normal frame output Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to the
 * output. If the original hardware frame is later required (for example, after overlaying something else on
 * part of it), the hwmap filter can be used again in the next mode to retrieve it.<br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * <li>Normal frame input, hardware frame output If the input is actually a software-mapped hardware frame,
 * then unmap it - that is, return the original hardware frame. <br>
 * <br>
 * Otherwise, a device must be provided. Create new hardware surfaces on that device for the output, then map
 * them back to the software format at the input and give those frames to the preceding filter. This will then
 * act like the hwupload filter, but may be able to avoid an additional copy when the input is already in a
 * compatible format.<br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * <li>Hardware frame input and output A device must be supplied for the output, either directly or with the
 * derive_device option. The input and output devices must be of different types and compatible - the exact
 * meaning of this is system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same underlying
 * hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card). <br>
 * <br>
 * If the input frames were originally created on the output device, then unmap to retrieve the original
 * frames. <br>
 * <br>
 * Otherwise, map the frames to the output device - create new hardware frames on the output corresponding to
 * the frames on the input.
 * </ul>
