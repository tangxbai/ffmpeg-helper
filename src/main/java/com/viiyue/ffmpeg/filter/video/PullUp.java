 * Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of handling mixed hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps
 * progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive content.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future context in making its decisions. This filter is
 * stateless in the sense that it does not lock onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the
 * following fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after pullup, use fps=24000/1001 if the
 * input frame rate is 29.97fps, fps=24 for 30fps and the (rare) telecined 25fps input.
