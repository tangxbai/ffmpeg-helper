/**
 * <p>
 * Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the grayscale value of a second input. This is
 * intended for use with alphaextract to allow the transmission or storage of frame sequences that have alpha
 * in a format that doesnâ€™t support an alpha channel.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video and a separate video created with
 * alphaextract, you might use:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * movie=in_alpha.mkv[alpha]; [in][alpha]alphamerge[out]
