/**
 * <p>
 * Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful to detect chapter transitions,
 * commercials, or invalid recordings.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The filter outputs its detection analysis to both the log as well as frame metadata. If a black segment of
 * at least the specified minimum duration is found, a line with the start and end timestamps as well as
 * duration is printed to the log with level info. In addition, a log line with level debug is printed per
 * frame showing the black amount detected for that frame.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The filter also attaches metadata to the first frame of a black segment with key lavfi.black_start and to
 * the first frame after the black segment ends with key lavfi.black_end. The value is the frameâ€™s timestamp.
 * This metadata is added regardless of the minimum duration specified.
